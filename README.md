ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Joey.

I spent 10 years in the hospitality industry and witnessed the challenges that led to many business closures.
This sparked my career shift to data analytics, where I now help businesses make data-driven decisions.

Currently, I work with sales and marketing data using Snowflake, SQL, Python, Azure, and Power BI.
I'm also advancing my expertise through a BA (Hons) in Global Business Management and a Specialist Diploma in Data Science.
