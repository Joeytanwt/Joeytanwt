# 👋 Hey there! I'm Joey

**Data Analyst | Singapore**

🔹 **Bio:**  
I spent 10 years in the hospitality industry and witnessed the challenges that led to many business closures.
This sparked my career shift to data analytics, where I now help businesses make data-driven decisions.

I mostly work with sales and marketing data but am open to exploring healthcare and finance data.
I'm also advancing my expertise through a BA (Hons) in Global Business Management and a Specialist Diploma in Applied Data Science.
